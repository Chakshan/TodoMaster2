# TodoMaster2
### Purpose
TodoMaster2 is an application that was created in order for its users to better plan out their day by listing out all of the things they must do. TodoMaster2 helps its users organize their plan of attack by asking them to prioritize their tasks and estimate how long each task will take. Users can sort their todo list based on each task's priority or estimated time of completition and can begin to complete each task with the order provided by TodoMaster. Users will also better understand how many tasks they have to do for the day and an estimate on how long it will take them to finish them.

### Acknowlegements
The creation of TodoMaster2 would not have been possible without the help of online resources and guidance especially from the [Swift documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/) and a [video uploaded by iOS Academy]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36sb5sc6lE") on YouTube which have helped me understand and create the table view and table view cells that are essential to the app's functioning. A fair amount of the code that can be found in my project was auto-generated by XCode when creating this app, but the logic found in the Task and TodoList structs as well as the body of the functions linked to buttons, labels, table view found in the ViewController file are of my own ideas.
